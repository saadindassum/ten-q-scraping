I'm thinking we can tell apart variations by their links.
But hey, that's just a theory.
A 10Q Scraping theory.

After 'data/' there's the CIK number without the 0's included.
The mystery right now is what the number means that come after that slash.
This might not lead anywhere.

Type 2
Sched titles are nested within divs, sometimes within a p, then a font tag, other times within just a p.
Within the same div, there will be another div containing the table. Text itself is nested differently according to
the microvariation.
As far as I can tell, micorvariations have the same length of link.

Type 2, microvar 0 links

Type 2, microvar 2  - dateless tables

TYPE 3
No container uniting the table and the title. The title is contained in one div per line.
My guess is our best bet is parsing for tables, then looking at the divs above (stopping at whichever one contains the table of contents)
And then determining if those divs contain "schedule of"

Microvar 0 - big div containing title div, easier to parse

Microvar 1 - separate divs for title. Blank div or table of contents text in div above title start

Microvar 2 - no divs, but p tags - SAME LENGTH AS T2MV2
